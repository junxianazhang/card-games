# Card Game Simulator For Pinochle And Texas Hold'em
A C++ project made for the Multi-Paradigm Programming In C++ course at Washington University in St. Louis.
This program accepts player names as input and will simulate the card game as if the players are playing through an algorithm.

## Running the Program
To run the program, you must use the gcc 8.3.0 version of the g++ compiler. After you have the right compiler, you can build the program by running ```make main``` in the src directory. Once you have built the program, you can start the program by running ```./main [GAME_NAME: Pinochle | HoldEm] [PLAYER_NAMES: 4 players for Pinochle and 2-9 players for HoldEm]``` in the same directory.
